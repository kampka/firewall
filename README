firewall - A simple firewall management tool based on iptables.
---------------------------------------------------------------

    The scope of this tool is to provide a simple iptables management solution
    intended to be used by a user as well as part of system init while providing
    an easy way to set up and manage sets of firewall rules.

    To deploy rules using the default target, create a script in
    /etc/firewall/rules.d that accepts 'start' and 'stop' as parameters.
    When called with the 'start' parameter, the script should take whatever
    steps are nessecarry to deploy its ruleset, 'stop' should revert these steps.

    firewall will automaticall evaluate all scripts
    in the directory that are both executable and have a ".rules" ending.
    To disable a ruleset, rename the file to ".rules.disabled"
    or remove the executable flag.

    firewall will not flush your tablespace or perform any cleanup beyond what
    is defined in the active rules file. Before disabling a ruleset,
    it is often nessecarry to call first stop the given ruleset by running
    'firewall stop <file.rules>'.

    Example:
    /etc/firewall/rules.d/apache.rules

    #!/bin/sh
    # Set up rules for port 80 access to an apache web server

    case $1 in
        start)
            /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

        stop)
            /sbin/iptables -D INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
